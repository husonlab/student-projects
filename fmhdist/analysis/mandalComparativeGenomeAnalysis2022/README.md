# Summary

This directory contains the analysis that was performed with dataset **A**.

The aim is to reproduce the phylogenies produced by [Mandal _et
al._](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.806398/full).
This paper produced a Phylogeny generated with MashTree. This NJ tree has some
issues, in particular with clade 8. The aim is to see if FracMinHash produces
better results, especially when compared with reference phylogenies published by
[Yang _et
al_.](https://imafungus.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.5598/imafungus.2017.08.02.09)
and the more recent publication by [Abad _et
al._](https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/wfbi/sim/2023/00000106/00000001/art00006;jsessionid=1k7qsx2bi06cd.x-ic-live-03).

In `their`, you can find the computational artifacts generated by re-applying
MashTree to the original dataset to obtain the phylogenetic distances. Those
distance where then fed into SplitsTree6 to generate NJ trees and phylogenetic
outlines. The generated splits were then exported from SplitsTree6.

In `mine`, you can find the computational artifacts generated by applying
FracMinHash, i.e. the CSV list, the sketch CSVs for different choices of $k$ and
$s$ as well as the generated distance matrices. The distances were fed into
SplitsTree6 as well and the resulting splits were exported for further comparison.

In `mappings` you will find various mapping files used to label the leaves in
SplitsTree.

Moreover, you'll find

- `k21_s2000_trees.nexus`, a file listing two trees from earlier stages of this
  project. This file is deprecated.
- `size_table.txt`, a table listing the different sketch sizes
- `split_comparison.txt` and `splits_fmh_parameters_comparison.txt`, the outputs
  generated by `../../misc/compare_splits.py` applied on the differences between
  mashtree and fmhdist (for $k=21$, $s=2000$) and applied on the differences
  between different fmhdist parameters, respectively
