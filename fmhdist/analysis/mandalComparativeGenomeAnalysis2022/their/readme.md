# Notes

For this, I've prepared a `list.txt` by applying

```bash
awk -F "," '{$1}' list.csv > list.txt
```

to remove the second column (the optional label for my tool). Then, I've executed

```bash
mashtree_bootstrap.pl --reps 10 -numcpus 4 --file-of-files list.txt -- --mindepth 0 > mashtree.out
```

To use the tree generated by mashtree, I need to relabel the nodes. I will use [[newick_utils]] for that.

I prepare the map as follows:

```bash
awk -F "," '{print $2}' list.csv > labels.txt
awk -F "," '{print $1}' list.csv | xargs basename -s ".fna" > filenames.txt
paste filenames.txt labels.txt > map.txt
```

and then re-label the nodes using

```bash
nw_rename mashtree.tree map.txt > renamed_tree.tree
```

This is the procedure to generate `mashtree_r10.tree`.

Moreover, I have saved the resulting distances to create a tree with SplitsTree
itself. Those can be found as `mashtree_r10_dist.out` (for the accession codes
as leaves) and `mashtree_r10_dist.nxs` (for the cryptic species names as
leaves).
